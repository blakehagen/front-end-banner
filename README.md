## Description
In the 'design' directory, there is a .jpg image with a very simple layout for a webpage. Using HTML, construct a sound layout for the page content. Using CSS, style the elements so they appear similar to the design. Using Javascript, animate the graphical background to cycle between at least 3 images. The background can slide, fade, or any other animation. Also, the 'Read More' link at the bottom of the paragraph should expand the area above so all the text is readable.

You are allowed to use jQuery if you wish, though it is definitely not required. The index.html page already includes jQuery from googleapis as well as several images from lorempixel.com to get you started.

Feel free to organize the code in to as many directories/files as you see fit.

Good luck and have fun!
